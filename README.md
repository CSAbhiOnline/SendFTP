**you can make a shortcut in the Startup folder, pointing to the script so that when the system reboots, the script starts running.

This is probably the most convenient way to send files. Other apps needs to interact with at least one or more windows. This is just Drag-n-Drop

Everyone is welcome to add suggestions or improvements**
